QUESTIONS

1. Which browser and which tools do you usually use to develop? (Operating system, browser, various tools).
I develop on linux platform (ie: ubuntu). Primary tools are Chromium and Firefox and their integrated dev tools. To enhance debug experience I use other contrib extensions, summarized by scope in: react, redux, vue, webdeveloper, animations, performance, etc.
Daily tasks are also accomplished with intellij products, vim and vscode.

2. How do you optimize assets? (CSS, Js, Images).
In the past, I used to solve those issues with php tools (symfony assets, drupal css-js squashing). Moreover from the advent of nodejs I switched to a different approach based primarly on gulp and now on webpack. Webpack enriched with performance and bundle plugins, code splitting, lazyloads, minimization, criticals path extraction, are for example fondamental topics in my today dev experience.
